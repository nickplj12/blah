## About

BLAH! is a fork of [Bussin Wattesigma](https://wattesigma.com) built with the Godot Engine and powered by the Chromium Embedded Framework (CEF). It revolutionises the web browsing experience by allowing you to use **shaders** and a bunch of other stuff that is supposed to "entertain" you.
